# Object_Detection_Using_Opencv
Developed a real-time Object Detection System using OpenCV and Deep Learning-based models (MobileNet-SSD with COCO dataset) to detect and classify multiple objects such as people, and household items. The project utilized pre-trained TensorFlow models integrated with OpenCV’s DNN module for high-speed image recognition.
